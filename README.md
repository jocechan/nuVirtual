# nuVirtual
Our final project is a web app that allows students to communicate with instructors during virtual office hours using a real-time chat service. NUVirtual allows for users to chat online, view transcripts of saved chats, and view chats posted as announcements by instructors (some of this functionality is still in development).

Our chat service can be found by following this link:
